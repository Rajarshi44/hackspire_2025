# PR Verification System Implementation

## Overview

The PR Verification System automatically detects when users claim to have resolved issues and verifies if corresponding pull requests exist. This helps track issue resolution and ensures proper documentation of fixes.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Resolution Detection**
The AI monitors chat messages for phrases indicating issue resolution:
- "I fixed the [issue/bug/problem]"
- "Issue is resolved"  
- "I solved the [specific problem]"
- "Created a PR for [issue]"
- "Pull request is ready"
- References to issue numbers like "#123"

### 2. **Smart PR Matching**
When a resolution claim is detected, the system:
- Fetches recent pull requests from the repository
- Analyzes PR titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Matches PRs with the claimed issue using:
  - Direct issue number references (#123)
  - Keyword matching from issue description
  - Author matching (same user who claimed resolution)
  - Timing analysis (recent PRs)

### 3. **Confidence Scoring**
Each match receives a confidence score:
- **High**: Direct issue reference + same author + recent timing
- **Medium**: Good keyword match + same author OR direct reference + different author
- **Low**: Keyword match only OR same author + timing but unclear content match

### 4. **Visual Verification Results**
The system displays verification results with:
- ✅ Success indicator for found matches
- ❌ Warning for no matches found
- Color-coded confidence levels (green/yellow/orange)
- Direct links to matching pull requests
- Match reasoning explanation

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Detection
```
User: "Hey, I just fixed the login bug mentioned earlier. Created PR #45 for it."

AI Response: "✅ PR Verification: I found 1 matching pull request for 'login bug'"
[Shows PR #45 with high confidence match]
```

### Manual Verification
```
User: "/solved login issue"

AI Response: "✅ PR Verification: Found 2 matching pull requests for 'login issue'"
[Shows matched PRs with confidence scores]
```

### No Matches Found
```
User: "I resolved the dashboard bug"

AI Response: "❌ PR Verification: No matching pull requests found for 'dashboard bug'. 
You mentioned creating a PR - it might not be visible yet or may need different keywords."
```

## Commands

### `/solved [issue description]`
Manually trigger PR verification for a specific issue.

**Examples:**
- `/solved login bug` - Verify PRs for login-related issues
- `/solved #123` - Verify PRs for issue #123  
- `/solved` - Verify PRs for recent issues

## Technical Implementation

### New AI Flows

1. **`ai-detects-issue-resolution.ts`**
   - Analyzes messages for resolution claims
   - Extracts issue references and confidence levels
   - Identifies resolution methods (PR, direct fix, etc.)

2. **`ai-matches-pr-with-issue.ts`**
   - Fetches recent PRs from GitHub API
   - Performs intelligent matching using multiple criteria
   - Returns ranked results with confidence scores

### Enhanced Chat Interface

- **Automatic triggering** on resolution claim detection
- **Manual verification** via `/solved` command
- **Rich UI display** of verification results with confidence indicators
- **Direct PR links** for easy navigation

### Message Schema Updates

```typescript
systemMessageType?: 'issue-list' | 'pr-list' | 'pr-verification'
```

New `pr-verification` type stores matching PR data with confidence scores and match reasoning.

## GitHub Integration

The system integrates with GitHub APIs to:
- Fetch both open and closed pull requests
- Analyze PR metadata (title, description, author, timing)
- Support issue number references and keyword matching
- Handle rate limiting and error scenarios gracefully

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Tracking**: No manual effort required to link issues with PRs
2. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures claimed fixes have corresponding code changes  
3. **Team Visibility**: Makes it easy to see resolution status of issues
4. **Process Improvement**: Encourages proper PR creation and linking practices
5. **Historical Record**: Creates audit trail of issue resolutions

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with GitHub issue linking (automatic closing)
- Support for multiple repositories  
- Enhanced AI analysis of code changes
- Notification system for unverified resolution claims
- Integration with project management tools
