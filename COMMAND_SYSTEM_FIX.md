# Command System Fix Documentation

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Command Suggestions Not Showing**
**Problem**: When typing "/", the command popover wasn't appearing or was conflicting with mention suggestions.

**Solution**: 
- Updated logic to show command popover when text starts with "/"
- Added proper state management to avoid conflicts between mention and command suggestions
- Modified MentionInput to respect `showCommandSuggestions` prop

### 2. **Cannot Type Continuously After "/"**
**Problem**: Input was getting blocked or interfering after typing the "/" character.

**Solution**:
- Fixed handleKeyDown logic to not interfere with command popover navigation
- Updated handleInputChange to maintain popover state properly
- Added proper keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, tab, escape)

## How Commands Work Now

### Triggering Commands
1. Type `/` in the message input
2. Command popover appears immediately with all available commands
3. Continue typing to filter commands (future enhancement)
4. Use arrow keys to navigate up/down
5. Press Enter or Tab to select a command
6. Press Escape to close without selecting

### Available Commands
- `/issue` - Create a new GitHub issue (supports @mentions for assignment)
- `/issuelist` - List all open issues in the repository
- `/prlist` - List all open pull requests
- `/solved [description]` - Mark an issue as solved and verify matching PRs
- `/collaborator` - Invite a new collaborator to the repository
- `/ask` - Ask the AI a question

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Arrow Down**: Move to next command
- **Arrow Up**: Move to previous command  
- **Enter/Tab**: Select highlighted command
- **Escape**: Close command popover

### Integration with Mentions
- When command popover is open, mention suggestions are hidden
- After selecting a command (like `/issue`), you can still use @mentions
- Mentions work seamlessly with issue creation and assignment

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

1. **MentionInput Component**
   - Added `showCommandSuggestions` prop
   - Updated suggestion logic to respect command mode
   - Modified keyboard handling to not interfere with commands

2. **MessageInput Component**  
   - Improved command detection logic
   - Better state management for popover visibility
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation support

3. **CommandPopover Component**
   - Added keyboard navigation with useState for selectedIndex
   - Implemented proper event handling for arrow keys
   - Added visual feedback for selected command (highlighting)

### State Management
```tsx
// Command popover state
const [showCommandPopover, setShowCommandPopover] = useState(false);

// Logic: Show when text starts with "/"
if (newText.startsWith('/')) {
    const spaceIndex = newText.indexOf(' ');
    if (spaceIndex === -1 || spaceIndex < 3) {
        setShowCommandPopover(true);
    }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Cases to Verify
1. **Basic Command Trigger**: Type "/" → should show command list
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys → should highlight different commands  
3. **Command Selection**: Press Enter → should insert selected command
4. **Continue Typing**: After selecting command → should allow normal text input
5. **Mention Integration**: Type `/issue @username` → should work seamlessly
6. **Command Completion**: Complete commands like `/issuelist` → should execute properly

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ "/" immediately shows command suggestions
- ✅ Arrow keys navigate through commands with visual highlight
- ✅ Enter/Tab selects the highlighted command
- ✅ Can continue typing after command selection
- ✅ Mentions work properly after command selection
- ✅ No conflicts between command and mention suggestions
- ✅ Escape closes command popover

The command system should now work smoothly with full keyboard navigation and proper integration with the existing mention system.
