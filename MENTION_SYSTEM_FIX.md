# Mention System Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified
After fixing the command system, the mention popup (@username suggestions) stopped working because the input mode switching logic was not properly detecting and handling "@" mentions.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was in the mode switching logic:

1. **Default textarea** wasn't extracting mentions properly
2. **Mode detection** `shouldUseMentionInput` wasn't triggering correctly  
3. **Mention extraction** was only happening in MentionInput component, not in default mode

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Default Mode Mention Detection**
Added mention extraction logic to the default textarea:

```typescript
// Extract mentions when in default mode
if (newText.includes('@')) {
  const mentionRegex = /@(\w+)/g;
  const extractedMentions: string[] = [];
  let match;
  while ((match = mentionRegex.exec(newText)) !== null) {
    extractedMentions.push(match[1]);
  }
  setMentions(extractedMentions);
}
```

### 2. **Improved Mode Detection Logic**
Updated `shouldUseMentionInput` to be more reliable:

```typescript
const shouldUseMentionInput = !isInCommandMode && (text.includes('@') || mentions.length > 0);
```

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
Added console logs to track:
- Input mode switching  
- Mention extraction
- Component rendering states

## Expected Behavior Now

### âœ… **Mention Flow**
1. **Type "@"** in default mode â†’ Mentions extracted automatically
2. **Next render** â†’ Switches to MentionInput component  
3. **Shows suggestions** â†’ Collaborator dropdown appears
4. **Select user** â†’ @username inserted properly
5. **Continue typing** â†’ Can add more mentions or regular text

### âœ… **Command + Mention Integration**
1. **Type "/issue"** â†’ Command mode, select command
2. **Type " @john"** â†’ Switches to mention mode, shows suggestions
3. **Complete message** â†’ "/issue Fix bug @john" works properly

## Debug Console Output

You should now see:
```
Input mode - isInCommandMode: false shouldUseMentionInput: true text: "hello @j" mentions: ["j"]
Extracted mentions in default mode: ["john"] 
Mention input change: "hello @john" mentions: ["john"]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Mode Switching Logic
- **Default Mode**: Regular textarea that can detect @ and / 
- **Command Mode**: When "/" detected â†’ CommandPopover + Textarea
- **Mention Mode**: When "@" detected â†’ MentionInput component

### Mention Extraction
- **Default Mode**: Basic regex extraction of @username patterns
- **Mention Mode**: Advanced extraction with collaborator matching
- **Consistent State**: Mentions array maintained across mode switches

### Integration Points
- Commands work independently
- Mentions work independently  
- Commands + mentions work together (e.g., "/issue @john fix bug")

## Testing Scenarios

### âœ… **Mention Tests**
1. **Type "@"** â†’ Should switch to mention mode
2. **Type "@j"** â†’ Should show collaborators starting with "j"
3. **Select "@john"** â†’ Should insert "@john " with space
4. **Multiple mentions** â†’ "@john @sarah" should work

### âœ… **Command + Mention Tests**  
1. **"/issue @john"** â†’ Should work seamlessly
2. **"/solved login bug @sarah"** â†’ Should extract mentions properly
3. **Mode switching** â†’ Should be smooth between command/mention modes

The mention system should now work properly while maintaining the command system functionality! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

If mentions still don't work:
1. Check console for debug logs
2. Verify `shouldUseMentionInput` is true when typing "@"
3. Ensure MentionInput component is rendering
4. Check if `useCollaborators` hook is fetching data properly
