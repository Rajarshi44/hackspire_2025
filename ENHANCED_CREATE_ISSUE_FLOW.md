Your `/gitpulse create-issue` command now has a complete GitHub authentication and repository selection flow!

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Smart GitHub Authentication**
- Detects if user has connected GitHub account
- Provides easy authentication flow if not connected
- Handles OAuth callback with success notification

### 2. **Repository Selection**
- Automatically fetches user's repositories from GitHub
- Shows dropdown with up to 25 most recent repos
- Filters out forks and archived repositories
- Option for manual repository entry

### 3. **Interactive Issue Creation Form**
- Step-by-step guided process
- Repository selection → Issue details → Creation
- Priority level selection (High/Medium/Low)
- Rich text formatting support

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Clear status messages at each step
- Error handling with helpful suggestions
- Success confirmations
- Ability to go back and change selections

## 📋 Complete User Flow

### Step 1: User runs command
```
/gitpulse create-issue
```

### Step 2a: If NOT authenticated with GitHub
```
🔐 GitHub Authentication Required

Why do I need to sign in?
• Create issues in your repositories
• Assign issues to team members
• Access private repositories
• Maintain proper attribution

[🔗 Connect GitHub Account] [❌ Cancel]
```

### Step 2b: If authenticated with GitHub
```
📝 Create GitHub Issue

🔗 Connected as: Your GitHub account
📁 Available repositories: 12 found

[Select repository dropdown ▼]

[📝 Continue with Issue Details] [🔄 Refresh Repositories]
```

### Step 3: Repository Selection
User selects from dropdown of their repositories:
- `username/project-1`
- `username/project-2`
- `organization/shared-project`
- etc.

### Step 4: Issue Details Form
```
📁 Selected Repository: `username/selected-repo`

📝 Now provide the issue details:

Issue Title * 
[e.g., Fix login bug on mobile devices]

Issue Description
[Describe the issue, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, etc.]

Priority Level: [Select priority ▼]
- 🔴 High Priority
- 🟡 Medium Priority  
- 🟢 Low Priority

[🚀 Create Issue] [↩️ Back to Repository Selection]
```

### Step 5: Issue Creation
```
🔄 Creating GitHub Issue...

Creating issue in: `username/selected-repo`
⏳ Please wait while I create the GitHub issue...
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Button Click** → Redirects to `/api/auth/github/slack?user_id=...`
2. **GitHub OAuth** → User authorizes GitPulse
3. **Token Storage** → Saved to Firestore with user mapping
4. **Success Message** → Sent back to Slack channel

### Repository Fetching
```typescript
// Fetches user's repositories from GitHub API
async getUserRepositories(slackUserId: string): Promise<string[]>
```
- Uses stored GitHub token
- Filters for owner repositories only
- Excludes forks and archived repos
- Limited to 25 most recent

### Interactive Components
- **Dropdowns** for repository selection
- **Form inputs** for issue details
- **Buttons** for navigation and submission
- **Real-time updates** without page refresh

## 🎮 Testing the Flow

### Test Authentication
1. Run `/gitpulse create-issue` with unauthenticated user
2. Click "Connect GitHub Account"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Verify success message in Slack

### Test Repository Selection
1. Run `/gitpulse create-issue` with authenticated user
2. Verify repositories appear in dropdown
3. Select a repository
4. Verify form appears

### Test Issue Creation
1. Fill out issue form
2. Select priority
3. Click "Create Issue"
4. Verify issue appears in GitHub (coming next)

## 🔄 Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Complete Issue Creation Logic
Add the actual GitHub API call to create issues:
```typescript
// In interactions handler
const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/${repository}/issues`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${githubToken}`,
    'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: issueTitle,
    body: issueDescription,
    labels: [priority]
  })
});
```

### 2. Add Error Handling
- Repository access permissions
- GitHub API rate limits
- Network failures

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Assignee selection
- Label management
- Template support
- Issue linking

## 🚨 Environment Requirements

Make sure these are set in your deployment:

```bash
# GitHub OAuth (required for authentication)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# Base URL (for OAuth redirects)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app

# Firebase (for storing user auth data)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... other Firebase config
```

## 🎯 User Benefits

1. **No Manual Setup** - Users connect their GitHub once and it's stored
2. **Repository Discovery** - Automatically finds their repositories
3. **Guided Process** - Step-by-step with clear instructions
4. **Error Recovery** - Helpful messages when things go wrong
5. **Slack Native** - Everything happens within Slack interface

The enhanced flow provides a professional, user-friendly experience for creating GitHub issues directly from Slack! 🎉
